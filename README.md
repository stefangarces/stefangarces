#### Hello, world! 👋 I'm a software engineer from the frosty yet cozy town of Gothenburg, Sweden. By day, I'm a code crafter at Volvo Group, where I'm revving up innovation one commit at a time 🚗💨

#### I'm passionate about all things coding, from solving complex problems to the simpler joy of figuring out a tricky crossword or unwinding with a huzzle game 🧩 I'm also a big football enthusiast. My heart beats for every goal scored by BK Häcken ⚽️ My curiosity is like a Nordic winter: never-ending... That's why I'm always on the prowl for new tech knowledge 🕵️‍♂️

#### I truly believe there's nothing you can't learn, and I put that philosophy to the test daily at work or on my GitHub. Here, you'll find a mix of repositories where I lab with code, experiment with new ideas, and share my journey of continuous learning. 🚀

#### So, take a look around, drop a star if you like what you see, and let's connect the dots in this vast coding universe together! 🔍✨
